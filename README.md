php-excel-reader
================

This package can be used to parse and access binary Excel files in pure PHP.  It can take the data of an Excel file in the binary format and parse it to take the spreadsheet structure.  The package provides several classes that extract the different parts of a spreadsheet and allow iterating those parts like workbooks, sheets, rows, columns and cells.
